## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The authors argue that open foundation models offer advantages such as higher customisation capabilities and transparency, but there are also some potential risks and challenges. To better understand these risks, the authors design a risk assessment framework and analyse several possible misuse scenarios. However, current research has not been able to effectively quantify the marginal risk of open base models relative to existing technologies. Therefore, the authors call for more empirical studies to validate their theoretical benefits and risks and provide direction for a more constructive debate.

### 2. Method Description 
The paper presents a six-step framework for assessing risk in open foundation models (OFMs). The framework includes threat identification, existing risks and defences, the relationship between existing defences and new risks, new risks that are easily defensible, uncertainties and assumptions, and risk mitigation measures.

### 3. Key concepts
_Open Foundation Models (OFMs)_ it refers those open foundation models for which model weights are widely available. These models have significant social and political impacts that promote competition, accelerate innovation, and improve the distribution of power.

### 4. Methodological improvements
By providing a systematic approach to assessing the risks of open-base models, the framework enables researchers to determine more precisely which risks are new and to more easily understand how to mitigate them. In addition, the framework takes into account factors such as technological advances and the likelihood of malicious actors adapting to new technologies, thereby improving its accuracy and reliability.

### 5. Issues addressed 
The framework addresses issues that exist when assessing the risks of open-base models, such as the lack of a systematic approach to assessment and the inability to clearly distinguish between different types of threats. It provides researchers with a comprehensive approach to assessing the risks of OBS and helps policymakers better understand the potential risks that OBS may pose.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on recommendations and calls for open foundational models, with specific suggestions for AI developers, researchers, policymakers, and competition regulators. In these recommendations, the authors mention a number of potential risks and challenges and highlight the need for more research to address them.

For AI developers, the authors recommend that they should transparently disclose their responsible AI practices and the responsible AI practices they recommend or commission to downstream developers or deployers. Also, when downstream developers procure base models, they should consider the responsible AI measures that have been implemented and their effectiveness, and implement or negotiate responsible AI practices accordingly. This will help ensure that responsible AI practices are not overlooked by utilising other upstream providers' base models.

For researchers, the authors suggest that they should conduct new research to clarify the risks of misuse of open base models. Specifically, they should focus more on articulating the status quo, constructing realistic threat models (or showing why speculative threat models can produce pervasive evidence) and considering the full supply chain of misuse.

For policymakers, government funding agencies should ensure that research into the risks of open base models is adequately funded and remains appropriately independent of the interests of base model developers. Further policy measures could be considered once the uncertainty around a particular

For competition regulators, the authors argue that open-base models have potential economic benefits, such as fostering innovation, decentralising power and promoting competition. However, the magnitude of these economic benefits is largely unsupported by large-scale economic analyses or market surveillance. Competition regulators should therefore invest in measuring the benefits of base models and the impact of openness on their benefits. 

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. This paper examines open foundation models (OFMs), clearly defines their characteristics, strengths, and risks, and proposes policy recommendations for different stakeholders. The article first describes five characteristics of open foundation models: wider access rights, higher customisability, local reasoning capabilities, inability to revoke access rights once published, and weaker monitoring mechanisms. 

  2. The authors then enumerate the benefits of open base models, including decentralised decision-making, reduced market concentration, facilitated innovation, accelerated science and increased transparency.
  
  3. The article explores the possible risks associated with open foundation models and proposes a framework to assess their marginal risks. Overall, this article is an important reference for understanding the impact of open-base modelling and its related policies.

### 2. Innovative points
In terms of research methodology, the authors adopt a decomposition analysis approach, dividing the social impacts into two steps: 
<br>&emsp;specifying the five characteristics of the open base model; 
<br>&emsp;analysing the benefits and risks it brings according to these characteristics. 

This methodology contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of open-base modelling and provides guidance for the formulation of relevant policies.

### 3. Future Works
Despite the in-depth study of open-base models in this paper, there are still some issues that need to be further explored. For example, how can the marginal risk of open-base modelling be measured? How to ensure that the use of open-base modelling does not lead to more unfairness or discrimination? These questions require more empirical research and policy exploration. In addition, as technology develops and society changes, the risks and advantages of open-base modelling will continue to change, so we need to constantly update and improve the relevant policies and measures.
