## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
By introducing an extensible framework, the paper guides future research directions and categorizes and describes collaboration mechanisms. The authors also explore the application of various multi-intelligent body systems in different domains, including 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, Q&A, and socio-cultural environments. Finally, the article summarizes key lessons, open challenges, and potential research directions to achieve the goal of collective intelligence in AI.

### 2. Method Description 
This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) based approach to implement collaborative behaviors. In this approach, each collaboration is supported by a communication channel c used to facilitate collaborative actions between multiple agents and allow them to work together to reach the final goal. Collaboration consists of three key steps: delegating agents to a specific goal, defining a collaboration mechanism, and making decisions between agents to reach the final goal.

Each collaboration channel is a mechanism for agents to work together with specific attributes: participants, type, structure, and strategy. For example, the channel type can be competitive, cooperative or synergistic, while the structure can be peer-to-peer, centralized or distributed. Differences in any of the attributes can lead to different collaborative channels. For example, in a point-to-point structured system, two LLMs may compete with each other while others cooperate; these different interactions lead to different collaboration channels. This flexible channel framework enables agents to adapt their interaction styles, optimizing multi-agent collaboration efforts and task efficiency for a variety of scenarios.

### 3.Methodological improvements
Compared to the traditional single-agent approach, the method proposed in this paper enhances the interaction and coordination among agents by introducing collaboration mechanisms and communication channels. This approach not only improves the efficiency of the agents, but also enables the agents to better adapt to complex environments and task requirements.

And, the method can adaptively adjust the type, structure, and strategy of the collaboration channel according to different scenarios and task requirements, thus further improving the collaboration effect and task completion rate of the agents.

### 4. Issues addressed 
The method proposed in this paper mainly addresses the problem of collaboration in multi-intelligent body systems. Specifically, it provides an effective mechanism to facilitate collaboration among agents so that they can work together and achieve the final goal. At the same time, the approach provides a more flexible way for agents to adapt to different scenarios and task requirements, thus improving their efficiency and performance.

For each comparison experiment, the paper does not provide specific evaluation indexes and scores, but rather presents different research cases to demonstrate the characteristics and advantages of each strategy and communication structure. For example, in terms of competitive strategies, the paper mentions an example about debates between two agents and another example about collaborative problem solving. In terms of communication structures, the paper mentions some examples based on distributed systems, such as applications in sensor networks and applications in the field of robotics.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
This thesis systematically explores collaboration in Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and presents a structured framework to guide future research. The framework includes five key dimensions: actors, types, structures, strategies, and coordination mechanisms, providing a systematic way to analyze and design collaborative interactions. And, the paper discusses challenges and unresolved issues in current research, such as unified governance, shared decision-making, digital species, scalability and resource maintenance, and unexpected generalizations. These discussions help drive further development in the field.

### 2. Innovative points
The paper proposes a new framework to analyze and design collaborative interactions in LLM-based MAS. The framework categorizes collaborative interactions into five key dimensions, thus providing a systematic approach to understand and design collaborative interactions. 

### 3. Future Works
As technology evolves, LLM-based MAS will become an increasingly important field. However, there are many challenges and unresolved issues that need to be addressed before this can be realized. For example, how to ensure the security and reliability of the system and how to deal with large-scale collaboration. Therefore, future research focuses on the development of more effective algorithms and techniques to improve the performance and reliability of the system and to facilitate the widespread use of LLM-based MAS in practical applications.
