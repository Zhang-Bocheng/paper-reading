## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
With the development of modeling algorithms, underlying models, and high-quality datasets, AI-generated content has achieved significant success, but still faces challenges such as updating knowledge, dealing with long-tailed data, mitigating data leakage, and managing high training and inference costs.The RAG technique enhances the generation process by introducing the process of information retrieval, which retrieves relevant objects from available data stores, thereby improving accuracy and robustness. 

This paper first categorizes the RAG foundations based on how the retrievers augment the generators and summarize the basic abstraction methods for the various retrievers and generators. Additional enhancement methods for RAG are then presented to facilitate effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems. This is followed by a survey of practical applications of RAG on different modalities and tasks from another perspective, providing valuable references for researchers and practitioners.

### 2. Method Description 
This paper proposes a system called RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), which consists of two core modules: a retriever and a generator. Among them, the retriever is responsible for searching relevant information from the data store, while the generator is responsible for producing the desired content. The specific process is as follows:

  1. The retriever first receives the input query and searches for relevant information.
  2. Then, the original query and retrieval results are passed to the generator through a specific enhancement method.
  3. Eventually, the generator produces the desired results.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. Ability to utilize external knowledge base to enrich the generated results;
  2. The ability to dynamically adjust the retrieval strategy to improve the quality of generation;
  3. Having stronger interpretability and controllability.

### 4. Issues addressed 
  1. Retrieval-based text generation models usually only rely on the information in the training corpus and cannot fully utilize the external knowledge base;
  2. Due to the lack of contextual information, the generated results may not be accurate or coherent enough;
  3. For some complex tasks, such as question and answer, summarization, etc., traditional retrieval-based text generation models are difficult to achieve high results.

## Experiments
This paper introduces techniques related to retrieval-based generative dialog systems (RAGs), and compares and analyzes them through several experiments. Specifically, the paper first introduces four typical RAG infrastructures, including **query-driven RAG, embedded representation RAG, logistic regression RAG, and guessing RAG**, and briefly outlines the basic principles and application scenarios of each approach. Then, this paper focuses on five methods to enhance the performance of RAG, including input enhancement, retriever enhancement, generator enhancement, result enhancement, and whole pipeline enhancement, and provides detailed descriptions and comparisons of the specific implementations and effects of each method.

In terms of experiments, this paper mainly uses two datasets for testing, namely the QA dataset and the code-completion dataset. For the QA dataset, this paper uses metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR to evaluate the generation quality of the system, while for the code-completion dataset, metrics such as edit distance and semantic similarity are used to measure the performance of the system. The specific experimental results and conclusions are as follows:

**Input Enhancement:** this method mainly improves the performance of the system by transforming the original query or preprocessing the data. Among them, methods such as Query2doc and TOC can effectively increase the information acquisition ability of the system, while Data Augmentation can reduce the sparsity and noise interference of the data.

**Retriever Enhancement:** this method is mainly used to improve the accuracy and recall of the system by optimizing the retrievers. Among them, methods such as Recursive Retrieval and Chunk Optimization can effectively improve the search efficiency and result quality of the system, while methods such as Retriever Finetuning and Hybrid Retrieval can further improve the system's generalization ability and adaptability.

**Generator Enhancement:** this method mainly improves the generation quality and diversity of the system by optimizing the generators. Among them, methods such as Latent Representation-based RAG and Logit-based RAG can effectively improve the generation quality and stability of the system, while methods such as Input Enhancement and Result Enhancement can further improve the response speed and user experience of the system.

**Result Enhancement:** this method mainly improves the usability and interpretability of the system by post-processing the output results of the system. Among them, methods such as Re-ranking and Retrieval Transformation can effectively improve the diversity and accuracy of the system, while others are some other optimization methods, such as text summarization using language models.
