## Methodology

### Abstract
The field of 3D content generation is rapidly evolving with the development of neural networks and generative modelling, enabling the creation of increasingly high-quality and diverse 3D models. This paper describes the basic approaches to 3D representation and provides a comprehensive overview categorising various algorithmic paradigms, including feed-forward generation, optimal generation, process generation and generative new view synthesis. In addition, available datasets, applications and open challenges are discussed. It is hoped that this review will help readers explore this exciting topic and contribute to the further development of the field of 3D content generation.

## Experiments
This article mainly introduces the application of neural scene representation in 3D generation and compares the advantages, disadvantages and scope of application of different types of neural scene representation. Specifically, the article classifies neural scene representations into three categories: explicit scene representations, implicit scene representations, and hybrid scene representations, and provides a detailed introduction and comparison of each type.

**For explicit scene representations**, the article lists several common methods, such as point clouds, meshes and multi-layer representations, and analyses their respective advantages and limitations. For example, point clouds can capture the details of object surfaces but are difficult to handle complex shapes; meshes can better represent the geometric structure of objects but have limited support for irregular shapes. In addition, the article mentions some applications of hybrid scene representations, such as using a combination of point clouds and meshes to improve the accuracy and efficiency of models.

**For implicit scene representations**, the article focuses on Neural Radiation Field (NeRF) and Neural Voxel Surface (NeS), and provides a detailed explanation of their principles and application scenarios. At the same time, the article also points out some limitations of these methods, such as high computation and slow rendering speed.

Finally, the article also introduces some 3D generation methods based on deep learning, such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based, Variational Autocoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model methods, and compares and analyses their performance and effects.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive and in-depth discussion on the application of neural scene representation in 3D generation, which provides an important reference and reference for research in related fields
