## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
Although initially a niche area in the field of natural language processing, LLMs have demonstrated amazing potential in a wide range of applications and domains, including games. The paper discusses under-explored areas and promising directions for future use of LLM, and reconciles the potential and limitations of LLM in the games domain. As the first paper to comprehensively survey the intersection of LLM and games, the authors hope it will lead to groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in games, and discusses and analyses them for different roles. In it, the definition and application scenarios of each role are described in detail, and relevant research cases and experimental results are listed.

Firstly, the paper mentions that LLM can be used as a player's role to play various types of games, including board games, text adventure games and so on. In this role, LLMs need to transform the game state into a sequence of inputs and play the game by predicting the next move. For example, in a board game, the LLM can be used to generate a probability distribution of the next best position to land a move by representing the current board state as a sequence and then feeding it into a pre-trained LLM. In text-based adventure games, the LLM then needs to convert the state described in natural language into a sequence of actions and optimise the strategy by means of a reinforcement learning algorithm.

Secondly, the article also mentions that LLMs can be used as non-player characters (NPCs) to play the role of assisting the player in the game. In this role, the LLM needs to be able to understand the relationship between the game world and the characters and be able to interact with the player in a dialogue. For example, in role-playing games (RPGs), the LLM can act as a virtual assistant to help the player complete quests or provide hints and information.

In addition, the article explores the role of the LLM as a commentator or narrator. In this role, the LLM needs to be able to generate descriptions about game events and be able to convey information about the progress of the game to the audience. For example, in an eSports tournament, the LLM could act as a commentator, explaining the rules of the game and the performance of the players to the audience.

Finally, the article suggests some future research directions, such as exploring how to make LLMs better adapted to different types of games, and how to improve LLMs' ability to perform in games.
 
## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
This article focuses on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in digital games and enumerates their potential benefits in terms of game design and player experience. It provides insights into the limitations and challenges of LLMs, such as the phenomenon of illusions, semantic errors, and lack of contextual comprehension, as well as ethical issues in terms of cost, privacy, and copyright. And, the paper proposes some solutions to these problems, such as the use of more efficient architectures, compressed memory mechanisms, interpretive techniques, etc.

### 2. Innovative points
The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive and in-depth study on the application of LLMs in digital games, and some new solutions are proposed to solve the related problems. Among them, the most innovative part is the detailed discussion on the limitations and challenges of LLMs, and how to overcome these limitations by some techniques and strategies. 

### 3. Future Works
Although this paper has provided a lot of information about the application of LLMs in digital games, there are still many uncharted areas that need further research. For example, how to better deal with the long-term dependencies of LLMs, how to improve their generation quality and accuracy, and how to use them in conjunction with other AI techniques, among others. As LLMs technologies continue to develop and improve, it is believed that they will play an increasingly important role in applications in digital games and other fields.
