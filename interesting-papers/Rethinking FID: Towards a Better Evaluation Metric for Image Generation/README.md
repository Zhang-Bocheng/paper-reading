## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The authors point out that the FID suffers from three main drawbacks: the Inception model does not represent well the content generated by modern text-to-image models, the wrong assumption of normal distribution, and low sample complexity. Also, FID is inconsistent with human evaluation, does not reflect the incremental improvement of iterative text-to-image models, and does not capture changes in the degree of image distortion. Therefore, the authors call for a reconsideration of FID as the primary assessment metric for generating image quality. In order to provide a more reliable and robust assessment, the authors propose a new metric, CMMD, based on CLIP embedding and maximum mean deviation distance of Gaussian radial basis functions.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
This paper proposes a new metric for evaluating image generation models, CMMD (CLIP-MMD), which measures the difference between the generated image and the real image by using CLIP embedding and maximum mean distance (MMD). The method has the following advantages:

  1. CMMD does not rely on the assumption of Frechet distance and is able to better reflect changes in image quality.
  2. CMMD calculates MMD based on Gaussian kernel function, which has better sample efficiency and computational efficiency.
  3. CMMD performs well in evaluating iterative text-to-image models and is able to capture image quality variations under complex noise.
  
### 2. Innovative points
The main innovation of this paper is to propose CMMD, a new evaluation metric for image generation models, which has better robustness and accuracy compared to the traditional FID metric. Specifically, CMMD adopts CLIP embedding and MMD distance as the evaluation criteria, which avoids the limitation of FID for data distribution assumptions, and also takes into account the sample efficiency and computational efficiency. 

### 3. Future Works
The further research can be conducted on how to combine CMMD with other metrics to assess the quality of image generation models more comprehensively. It can also explore how to use CMMD to guide the design and optimisation of image generation models to improve their performance and effectiveness.
