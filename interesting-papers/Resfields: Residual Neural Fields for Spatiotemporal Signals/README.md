## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
Conventional neural fields use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to represent high-frequency signals, but still have limitations when dealing with large and complex time-series data. By adding a temporal residual layer to neural fields, ResFields can capture time-series information more efficiently and can be seamlessly integrated on top of existing MLPs. Experimental results show that ResFields can improve performance on a variety of challenging tasks, including 2D video approximation, dynamic shape modeling, and dynamic NeRF reconstruction. 

### 2. Method Description 
The paper proposes a method called "Residual Neural Fields" for modeling and reconstructing time-series signals. CNN are prone to capacity bottlenecks when dealing with complex, long-sequence signals, resulting in slower training times and requiring more GPU memory. To address this problem, Residual Neural Fields introduces residual field layers to efficiently capture large and complex temporal signals. This approach increases model capacity by adding trainable parameters without changing the overall network architecture, and does not increase the number of layers or neurons in the MLP.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. The main improvement of Residual Neural Fields is the introduction of a time-conditional residual layer to replace the linear layer in traditional MLPs.
  
  2. This residual layer can effectively capture the complexity and variations of spatio-temporal signals, which improves the representation of the model.
  
  3. In addition, to avoid the spatial segmentation problem caused by assigning too many independent parameters, the method employs a low-rank factorization technique to directly optimize the trainable parameters into a collection of coefficients and cosines in the temporal and spatial dimensions, which reduces the number of total parameters and prevents the potential overfitting phenomenon.
     
### 4. Issues addressed 
Residual Neural Fields primarily addresses the capacity bottleneck faced by traditional NN when processing complex, long sequence signals. By introducing a residual field layer and a low-rank factorization technique, the method is able to effectively capture the complexity and variability of spatio-temporal signals while avoiding spatial segmentation problems and overfitting phenomena. This enables Residual Neural Fields to achieve high learning capacity and good generalization performance under a limited parameter budget for a variety of spatio-temporal signal modeling and reconstruction tasks.

## Experiments
This paper describes the authors' ResFields approach to neural field modeling and evaluates and compares it through four challenging tasks. These tasks include:

**2D Video Approximation**: this task aims to evaluate the model's ability to map pixel coordinates to RGB colors. The authors used two video datasets and divided them into a training set and a validation set. They applied the trained NN to the validation set and used the mean mean square error (PSNR) as an evaluation metric. The results show that using ResFields significantly improves the reconstruction quality and generalization ability compared to pure MLP.

**Spatial Distance Function Learning**: this task involves mapping temporal spatial coordinates onto a distance function of the shape surface. The authors used a sequence of Deforming Things and converted them to SDF values. They then trained the NN using MAPE loss and used L1 Chamfer distance and normal consistency as evaluation metrics. The results show that using ResFields significantly improves the reconstruction quality and generalization performance.

**Dynamic Neural Radiation Fields (NERF)**: this task aims to model the geometric and textural information of a dynamic scene by learning neural fields. The authors used Owlii sequences and divided them into training and test sets. They trained the NN using the l1 error, the difference between rendered opacity and gt mask, and the Eikonal error, and used the L1 Chamfer distance and standard image metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM) as evaluation metrics. The results show that the use of ResFields significantly improves the results of all benchmark methods and achieves a new optimum for dynamic scenes in sparse multiview reconstruction.

**Scene Flow Estimation**: this task involves learning 3D motion fields to characterize the motion of each point in time and space. The authors use the Deforming Things sequence and apply it to learn bi-directional scene flow. They use the l1 error as a supervised signal and consider three different motion models. The results show that using ResFields significantly improves the effectiveness of learning scene flow.
