| 2024 | This paper describes a video editing system called LAVE that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent assistants and provides enhanced language capabilities.          | Large Language Models (LLMs)         |

## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The system automatically generates a textual description of the video captured by the user, which serves as the basis for the LLM to process the video and assist in the editing task. When the user provides editing goals, the agent plans and executes the relevant actions to achieve those goals. In addition, LAVE allows the user to edit either directly using the interface or through the agent, thus providing flexibility and enabling the user to manually adjust the agent's operation. 

The authors conducted a study with eight participants including novice to skilled editors, the results of which demonstrated the effectiveness of LAVE and explored users‘ perceptions of the proposed LLM-assisted editing paradigm and its impact on users’ creativity and sense of co-creation. Based on these findings, the authors make design recommendations to guide the future development of agent-assisted content editing.

### 2. Method Description 
The paper proposes a new system called Language as Medium for Video Editing (LAVE), which aims to lower the threshold of video editing by interacting with the user through natural language and to provide the user with richer creative tools.LAVE consists of three main components: 1) a language-enhanced video library, 2) a video editing timeline, and 3) a video editing Agent. 

The Language Enhanced Video Library automatically generates titles and summaries for each video to help users better understand the content. The Video Editing Timeline allows users to drag and drop clips on the timeline in order to put the clips in order. The Video Editing Agent is a chat-based component that interacts with users through free-form language to provide video editing assistance.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. The core idea of LAVE is to apply NLP techniques to the video editing process in order to improve the user's operational efficiency and creativity. Compared with traditional command line tools, LAVE adopts a more intuitive and friendly interface design, enabling users to understand and use various functions more easily.
  2. In addition, LAVE supports a variety of natural language query methods, such as searching for related videos by topics or keywords, thus improving users' work efficiency.

### 4. Issues addressed 
  By introducing NLP technology, LAVE lowers the threshold of video editing, making it easy for more people to edit videos. At the same time, LAVE also provides a wealth of creative tools that can help users complete video production tasks faster. 
  
## Experiments
This paper presents the results and findings of the authors' experiment using the LAVE (Language-Aware Video Editor) editing tool in a user study. The experiment was designed to explore the use of natural language processing techniques in multimedia editing and assessed the impact of LAVE on user experience.

**Satisfaction with editing results:** the authors used a questionnaire to find out how satisfied the participants were with the final editing results. The results showed that all participants were able to use LAVE to complete video editing tasks easily and most of them were satisfied with the final results.

**Feelings during the editing process:** the authors also collected data on the participants' feelings of pleasure, autonomy, and creativity during the editing process. The results showed that participants generally found LAVE easy to use and helpful in increasing their creativity and autonomy.

**Evaluation of different features of LAVE:** The authors also conducted a user feedback survey on different features of LAVE, including video retrieval, script overview, brainstorming and storyboarding. The results showed that participants generally liked these features and felt that they helped them to better understand and organise the video footage.

**Trust in LAVE and Assignment of Responsibility:** the authors also investigated participants' trust in the level of automation in LAVE and their sense of responsibility in the editing process. The results showed that participants generally trusted LAVE's level of automation and felt that they still had a high level of control in the editing process.

**Perceptions of LAVE roles:** the authors also investigated participants' perceptions of LAVE roles, i.e., assistant, partner, or leader. The results showed that half of the participants perceived LAVE as an assistant and the other half as a partner.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. This thesis proposes a language-enhanced video editing tool (LAVE) based on NLP techniques, aiming to achieve intelligent assistance in the video editing process by integrating with a language model (LLM). Specifically, LAVE is designed with a plan execution agent that understands the user's free-form linguistic commands and performs relevant actions according to the user's editing goals.
  2. In addition, LAVE uses Visual Language Modelling (VLM) to automatically generate video descriptions to help the LLM understand the video content and provide more accurate editing suggestions. The authors conducted a user study that demonstrated the significant advantages of LAVE in improving video editing efficiency and creativity.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The main innovation of the paper is the combination of NLP techniques and the video editing domain, which enables intelligent assistance in the video editing process through the introduction of linguistic models and visual language models.
  2. In addition, the authors propose the design of a plan execution agent that understands the user's free-form linguistic commands and performs relevant operations according to the user's editing goals. This design provides a reference for future multimedia content editing tools.
     
### 3. Future Works
Further research is needed to better incorporate interaction methods such as speech recognition and gesture control to improve user experience. In conclusion, with the continuous development of natural language processing technology and computer vision technology, we believe that more innovative multimedia content editing tools will appear in the future.
