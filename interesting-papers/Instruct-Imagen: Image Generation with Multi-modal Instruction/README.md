## Methodology

### Abstract
The model introduces multimodal instructions for image generation, using natural language to merge different modalities (e.g. text, edges, style, theme, etc.) into a uniform format in order to standardise the various generative intents. The authors fine-tuned the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model in two stages to enhance its generative capabilities in external multimodal contexts. 

Subsequently, they fine-tuned the adapted model to enable it to perform well on a variety of image generation tasks requiring visual linguistic understanding, each equipped with a multimodal instruction containing the essence of the task. Experimental results show that Instruct-Imagen matches or exceeds previous models dedicated to specific tasks in human evaluations on a variety of image generation datasets, and demonstrates good generalisation to unseen and more complex tasks.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on the authors' proposed multimodal image generation model, Instruct-Imagen, and conducts several comparative experiments to verify its performance and advantages. Specifically, the authors conducted the following three experiments:

Experiment 1: Instruct-Imagen was compared with several benchmark methods, including SDXL, ControlNet, Ghiasi et al., StyleDrop, SuTI, and TamingEncoder, in an in-domain task evaluation. The results show that Instruct-Imagen performs well on several tasks, especially on tasks with less data (e.g., stylised generation).

Experiment 2: In the zero-sample task evaluation, Instruct-Imagen is compared with several benchmark methods, including KOSMOS-G and BLIPDiffusion, etc. The results show that Instruct-Imagen is able to show better generalisation ability in the zero-sample case and can handle a wide range of different tasks.

Experiment 3: Instruct-Imagen was further analysed and explored, including the exploration of important designs in its training process and the analysis of its failure modes. The results show that Instruct-Imagen is very adaptable and can be used for new tasks, but some constraints need to be noted, such as certain errors that may occur when using complex multimodal instructions.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. **Adaptable:** by using a uniform instruction format, Instruct-Imagen is able to integrate different types of multimodal information and flexibly apply it in different tasks.
  2. **High versatility:** Instruct-Imagen is not only suitable for text-prompting tasks, but can also handle other types of information (e.g., edges, styles, etc.), making it more widely applicable.
  3. **Effective:** Experimental results show that Instruct-Imagen performs well on a variety of complex tasks, even exceeding the optimal models in the current domain.
Methodological Innovations

### 2. Innovative points
  1. **Multimodal instruction design:** the authors design an instruction format containing textual descriptions and multimodal contexts to improve the model's understanding of the task.
  2. **Two-stage training strategy:** efficient knowledge transfer and generalisation capabilities are achieved by first enhancing network performance using similar data and then fine-tuning for multiple tasks.
  3. **Cross-domain applications:** Instruct-Imagen can be applied not only to text-prompting type of tasks, but also handle other types of information (e.g., edges, styles, etc.), making it more widely applicable.
 
### 3. Future Works
  1. **Multimodal information fusion optimisation:** investigating how to better fuse different types of information together to improve model performance.
  2. **Cross-modal task extension:** try to extend the application of Instruct-Imagen to more kinds of image generation tasks, such as video generation and 3D scene generation.
  3. **Model Interpretability and Interpretability:** explore how to improve the model's interpretability and interpretability in order to facilitate the understanding and adaptation of the model's behaviour.
