## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
While traditional meta-learning methods require gradient computation in inner loops, Implicit MAML avoids the memory and computational burden problems by only knowing the solution of the inner loops without knowing the specific paths of the inner loops. Experimental results show that implicit MAML can compute accurate meta-gradients with less memory overhead without increasing the total computational cost, and achieves better results on tasks such as image recognition.

### 2. Method Description 
The iMAML (Implicit Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) proposed in this paper is a meta-learning algorithm for fast adaptation to new tasks with small amount of data. The algorithm is based on the idea of model bootstrapping, which updates the model parameters by calculating the gradient of the task-specific parameters. Compared with the traditional MAML algorithm, iMAML uses a more efficient algorithm to compute the gradients of task-specific parameters, thus reducing memory consumption and computation time.

Specifically, iMAML treats the inner optimization problem as a black-box function and uses backpropagation to compute its gradient. The gradient is then passed back to the outer optimization problem via the chain rule to update the model parameters. This approach avoids explicitly solving the inner-layer optimization problem, and thus can significantly reduce memory consumption and computation time.

### 3. Methodological improvements
1. Compared to the traditional MAML algorithm, iMAML employs a more efficient algorithm for computing the gradients of task-specific parameters. Specifically, it uses backpropagation to compute the gradient instead of explicitly solving the inner optimization problem. 

2. This approach not only reduces memory consumption and computation time, but also improves the convergence speed and stability of the algorithm.

3. In addition, iMAML introduces a technique called "partial matrix inversion" to approximate the gradient. This technique efficiently computes the inverse of a matrix without explicitly storing or computing the entire matrix. This further reduces memory consumption and computation time.

### 4. Issues addressed 
iMAML solves the following two main problems:

1. **Memory Consumption**: Traditional MAML algorithms need to explicitly solve the inner optimization problem and therefore require a large amount of memory to store intermediate results. iMAML uses a more efficient algorithm to compute the gradient of a task-specific parameter, thus greatly reducing memory consumption.

2. **Computation Time**: Traditional MAML algorithms require explicitly solving the inner optimization problem and therefore take a long time to compute. iMAML greatly reduces the computation time by using techniques such as backpropagation and partial matrix inversion.

## Experiments
In this paper, the following four main experiments were conducted:

For the first aspect: **whether the iMAML algorithm can accurately compute the meta-gradient**, the authors used a simple synthetic regression example to verify this. The results show that the iMAML algorithm approximates the meta-gradient more accurately than the MAML algorithm within a limited number of iterations, and the error of the iMAML algorithm gradually decreases with the increase of the number of iterations, and finally tends to zero.

For the second aspect: **which one is closer to the true value of the meta-gradient within a limited number of iterations**, iMAML algorithm compared to MAML algorithm, the authors also conducted experiments to prove it. The results show that the iMAML algorithm is closer to the true value of the meta-gradient than the MAML algorithm, and only a small number of CG steps are needed to achieve this effect.

For the third aspect: **how the iMAML algorithm compares to the MAML algorithm in terms of computational and memory requirements**, the authors chose the Omniglot dataset for testing. The results show that the iMAML algorithm requires significantly less computational and memory resources compared to the MAML algorithm, and that it performs well for different numbers of class labels and sample sizes.

The last aspect: **about how well the iMAML algorithm performs in real-world applications**. The authors used two datasets, Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet, for testing and compared the iMAML algorithm with several other common meta-learning algorithms. The results show that the iMAML algorithm performs well on all these datasets, especially when using the Hessian-free optimization method.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1.
