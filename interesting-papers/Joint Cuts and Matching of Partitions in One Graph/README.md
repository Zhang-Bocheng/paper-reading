## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
   The authors first give a formal description of the problem, and then propose an optimization algorithm for alternately updating matching and cutting, and give a theoretical analysis. The algorithm achieves good results in both synthetic datasets and real-world images.
   
### 2. Method Description 
  This thesis proposes a joint graph-cutting and graph-matching approach to solve the partitioning problem in single-input images. First, an initial graph cut scheme is obtained by solving the eigenvectors of the Laplace matrix, and a standard graph matching algorithm is used to compute the initial graph matching scheme. Then, an iterative optimization algorithm is used to update the graph cutting and graph matching schemes until convergence. In each iteration, the graph cut energy is computed based on the current graph matching scheme, and then the graph matching energy is computed based on the graph cut scheme, and the two are added together as a total energy function for minimization. Finally, the discretized graph matching scheme is obtained by the Hungarian algorithm, and the partition to which each pixel belongs is determined based on its results.

### 3. Methodological improvements
 The advantage of this method is that it is able to consider both graph cutting and graph matching problems at the same time, thus better capturing the structural information in the image. In addition, the method employs an iterative optimization algorithm to gradually improve the graph-cutting and graph-matching schemes, making the final results more accurate. However, since the method requires global optimization of the entire image, it has high computational complexity and may not be applicable to large-scale image processing tasks.
 
## Experiments
  This paper presents the authors' testing and comparison of a new graph matching algorithm, IBGP. First, a comparison of four popular graph matching algorithms (including GAGM, IPFP, RRWM, and SM) with IBGP is carried out on synthetic data to test the performance under different noises, perturbations, and density variations, and it is found that IBGP has high stability and accuracy. Secondly, joint graph cutting and matching was tested on synthetic data, by randomly generating different parameter values to simulate different disturbance scenarios and using the average accuracy as an evaluation metric, and the results showed that CutMatch has better performance and robustness compared to other methods. Finally, the joint graph cutting and matching is tested on real images, and by comparing the randomly generated graphs under different densities, the results show that CutMatch can also achieve better results when processing real images. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the superior performance and stability of IBGP and CutMatch on the graph matching problem.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. In this paper, a new model is proposed to solve the joint graph cut and match problem and an efficient optimization algorithm IBGP is used to solve the problem.
  
  2. This new model is able to better consider the situation of two similar objects appearing in a single image and can achieve a better balancing effect.
  
  3. In addition, this paper presents some application areas such as stereo, video synthesis, and image segmentation.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel model that combines graph cuts and matching to achieve better balancing results.
  
  2. Also, the authors propose a new optimization algorithm, IBGP, for solving the joint graph cut and matching problem. This algorithm has theoretical guarantees to find a steady-state solution.
  
  3. In addition, the article mentions some room for improvement, such as an accelerated method for dealing with dense correspondences and an extension to multi-partition problems.
     
### 3. Future Works
  Although the model and algorithm proposed in this paper have made some progress, there is still some room for improvement. For example, the annealing strategy can be introduced to avoid falling into local optimal solutions; the efficiency of the algorithm can be improved by accelerating the processing of dense correspondences; and it can be extended to problems with multiple partitions.
