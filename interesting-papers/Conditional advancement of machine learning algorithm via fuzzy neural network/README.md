## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
Due to the complexity of the relationships between different validation metrics, a reliable validation algorithm or model is needed to integrate all existing validation metrics into a single value in order to assess and monitor the overall performance of the algorithm and to determine the direction of improvement. To this end, this paper proposes a new parameterised model called Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), which uses a neural adaptive learning strategy to tune predefined parameters of the affiliation function and add them to any Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) loss function as regularisation term to generate the constrained-CNN-FUZZY model optimisation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the authors created a toy dataset on the MNIST dataset and demonstrated brain lesion segmentation using a medical dataset.

### 2. Method Description 
This paper presents a hybrid model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) for evaluating performance validation metrics in medical image segmentation problems. The model optimises the neuro-fuzzy system by exploiting non-linear relationships and runs the two networks independently during the training and testing phases. In this case, the CNN is responsible for processing the data and extracting features, while the FNN uses an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to predict the best performance and minimise the prediction error based on defined input and output variables. This hybrid architecture can be seamlessly applied to any existing machine learning algorithm.

### 3. Methodological improvements
The method employs a state-of-the-art U-net model for the segmentation problem in medical image analysis tasks. Specifically, it is an adaptive deep multi-task learning framework that supports long-term training and testing strategies. The model uses three key components: the first is a CNN architecture with multiple parameters; the second is a loss function that jointly uses multiple loss functions; and the third is trained using stochastic optimisation techniques such as the Adadelta optimiser.

### 4. Issues addressed 
The main objective of this method is to address the problem of evaluating performance validation metrics in medical image segmentation problems. Traditionally, this problem is usually done manually, requiring time-consuming manual labelling of large amounts of data. Therefore, the researchers developed an automated solution to improve efficiency and accuracy. By combining CNNs and FNNs, the method is able to effectively capture the complex non-linear relationships between different performance validation metrics and generate high-quality labels, thus providing more accurate guidance for machine learning algorithms.

## Experiments
This paper presents several comparative experiments conducted by the authors to validate the performance and effectiveness of their proposed hybrid model in image segmentation tasks. Specifically, the experiments include the following:

Experiment 1: The CNN model was trained using the MNIST dataset and the performance performance under different experimental settings was compared. The authors used seven complementary evaluation metrics to assess the segmentation results, which were evaluated by a five-fold cross-validation method. The results show that ANFIS can be used to determine the degree of improvement of a CNN and that it provides more comprehensive information than a single evaluation metric.

Experiment 2: The CNN model was tested using the ISBI2015 MS Lesion Segmentation dataset and the performance under different experimental settings was compared. The authors also used seven complementary evaluation metrics to assess the segmentation results and evaluated them through a five-fold cross-validation method. The results show that ANFIS can be used to determine the degree of improvement of CNNs and that it provides more comprehensive information than a single evaluation metric.

Experiment 3: The pre-trained ANFIS model was tested using a synthetic dataset and the performance was compared across different experimental settings. The authors used six evaluation metrics to assess the segmentation results and calculated the ANFIS results. The results show that ANFIS can be used to determine whether the overall performance of the ML algorithm has improved or deteriorated and can reflect the gradual deterioration trend of the segmentation process.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. This study presents an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system that provides an automated method for comprehensively monitoring the performance of machine learning algorithms.
  2. The researchers applied this method to compare optimisation methods for different image segmentation results from the MNIST digital dataset and the brain MRI lesion segmentation dataset using various performance evaluation metrics.
  3. The results show that the system can effectively assess the quality of segmentation results obtained from multiple performance analysis metrics.
  4. The method has the ability to validate algorithms or models with a higher degree of reliability than existing scientific knowledge or research papers, and is able to combine all available validation metrics to directly determine the performance of machine learning algorithms.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The use of neuro-fuzzy networks effectively reduces the complexity between the results of individual metrics and solves the problem of defining high-dimensional, real-valued, and highly non-linear functions that describe the complex interrelationships between all applicable validation metrics.
  2. The method is fully adaptable to a wide range of validation metrics and is applicable to any segmentation model.
  3. The most relevant validation metrics can be selected to reflect and correlate with clinical importance, e.g. involving experienced radiologists for tumour/lesion labelling. 

### 3. Future Works
  1. The proposed parametric nonlinear function can be incorporated directly into the CNN loss function as a regularisation term to optimally constrain the CNN-fuzzy model.
  2. The method may face some challenges such as dealing with noisy data and overfitting problems. These problems can be solved by increasing the amount of training data and tuning the hyperparameters.
