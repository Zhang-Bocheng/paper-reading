## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
  The basic idea of the method is to first train the model by using a large amount of unlabeled data through unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, and then use the unlabeled data to further optimize the model and transfer it to specific tasks. Experimental results show that the method achieves significant performance gains on the ImageNet dataset and becomes more effective as the number of labels decreases. The method can be applied to a variety of CV tasks and has high practical value.
  
### 2. Method Description 
  The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework based on self-supervised learning that uses unlabeled data for pre-training in both task-independent and task-relevant ways, and further optimization using unlabeled data to improve the prediction performance and obtain a compact model. 
  
  Specifically, the method employs SimCLRv2 as a pre-training method with unlabeled data, and comparative experiments reveal that improvements such as increasing the model depth and width, as well as the use of SK, can significantly improve the model performance. In addition, when using a small number of labeled samples for fine-tuning, the model performance can be further improved by introducing unlabeled samples for knowledge distillation.
  
### 3. Key concepts
  _Self-supervised learning_: A type of ML where the model learns to generate its own labels from the input data, instead of relying on manually labeled data. It is a subset of unsupervised learning that aims to leverage the structure inherent in the data to create a supervised learning signal.
  
### 4. Methodological improvements
  1. Compared with the traditional self-supervised learning method, the method improves the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of the model by introducing more unlabeled data for pre-training and transferring the information from unlabeled data to labeled data by means of knowledge distillation.
     
  2. At the same time, the method also performs different optimizations for different model architectures, such as increasing the model depth, width, and using SK, so that the model can better adapt to the data distribution in various scenarios.

### 5. Issues addressed 
  This method addresses the problem of traditional self-supervised learning methods in dealing with large-scale unlabeled data, i.e., how to make full use of such data to improve model performance. By introducing more unlabeled data for pre-training and incorporating knowledge distillation to transfer information from unlabeled data to labeled data, the model is able to better capture the relationship between the data, which improves the model's generalization ability and prediction accuracy. In addition, the method is optimized differently for different model architectures, enabling the model to better adapt to the data distribution in various scenarios.
