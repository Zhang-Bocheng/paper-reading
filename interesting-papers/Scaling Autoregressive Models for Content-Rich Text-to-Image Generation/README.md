## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The model treats the text-to-image generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, similar to machine translation, but using image tokens as the target output instead of text tokens in another language. This approach can naturally capitalize on the rich body of work on large-scale language models that have seen sustained capability and performance gains from increasing data and model sizes. The authors employ the Transformer-based image tagger ViT-VQGAN to encode images into sequences of discrete tokens, and achieve consistent quality improvements by scaling the codec Transformer model to 20 billion parameters. 

Experimental results show that the model has a high zero-sample FID score of 7.23 on MS-COCO and a fine-tuned FID score of 3.22. In addition, the authors present a new comprehensive benchmark test, PartiPrompts (P2), including more than 1600 English prompts, to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Finally, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the model and discuss its limitations in order to further improve the field.

### 2. Method Description 
Parti is a text-to-image generation model based on an image encoder-decoder architecture. The model consists of two stages: **an image encoder and a decoder**. In the first stage, an image encoder is trained using ViT-VQGAN to convert the input image into a set of discrete visual tokens. The second stage is a standard autoregressive decoder that generates images by predicting image tokens. The decoder uses a sentence fragment model as a text encoder and uses a DALL-E-like approach to train the model.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. **Image encoder**: an image encoder is trained using ViT-VQGAN, which will be used to convert the input image into a set of discrete visual tokens.
  
  2. **Autoregressive decoder**: use a standard autoregressive decoder to generate images by predicting image tokens.
  
  3. **Text encoder pre-training**: pre-training using C4 corpus and image text data to improve the generalization ability of the text encoder.
 
  4. **Classifier Free Guidance and Rearrangement**: apply classifier free guidance and rearrangement techniques to improve the alignment between the output image and text.

### 4. Issues addressed 
  1. Generating high-quality, photorealistic images so that they accurately render a given text description.
  
  2. Handling challenging textual cues, such as those containing complex scenes or multiple objects.
  
  3. Improving the speed and efficiency of generation while maintaining high generation quality.

## Experiments
This article focuses on the performance of the Parti model on a text-to-image generation task with several sets of comparative experiments. Specifically, the article first introduces the training data and input processing of the Parti model, and then conducts the following sets of comparison experiments:

**Automated Evaluation Metrics Comparison Experiment**: this experiment uses FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) as an automated evaluation metric to measure the quality of the generated images and their consistency with the input text. The results show that the Parti model achieves better results in both zero-shot and fine-tuned cases, especially in the finetuned case, its FID score reaches 3.22, which outperforms the other models.

**Human Evaluation Comparison Experiment**: This experiment further verifies the superiority of the Parti model in generating high-quality and realistic images by comparing the output of the Parti model with that of other models such as XMC-GAN, as well as comparing it with real images. The results show that the Parti model outperforms other models in most cases, and even sometimes better than real images.

**More experiments**: In addition to the above experiments, the authors conducted more experiments, including automatic evaluation of image quality, automatic evaluation of image-text consistency, tests on different types and levels of challenging texts, etc. The results of these experiments further confirmed the superiority of the Parti model in generating high-quality, realistic images, even better than real images in most cases. The results of these experiments also further confirm the superiority of the Parti model in text-to-image generation tasks.
