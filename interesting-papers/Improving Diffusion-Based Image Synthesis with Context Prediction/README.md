## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
Unlike traditional pixel- or feature-based constraints, CONPREDIFF uses a context decoder to reinforce each point's prediction of the surrounding context and embeds it in a diffusion denoising block during the training phase. This approach can be applied to arbitrary discrete and continuous diffusion backbones and does not require the introduction of additional parameters for sampling. Experimental results show that CONPREDIFF performs better than previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on unconditional image generation, text-to-image generation and image interpolation tasks.

### 2. Method Description 
CONPREDIFF, proposed in this paper, is a diffusion model-based image generation method, the core idea of which is to predict the neighbourhood information around a pixel, feature point, or image token during the training process, and use this information to better reconstruct each pixel/feature/token. Specifically, CONPREDIFF uses a U-Net or transformer network for point-to-point denoising, along with a neighbour decoder to predict the neighbour information around the pixel/feature/token in K steps. In reconstructing the neighbourhood information, CONPREDIFF represents the neighbourhood information as a distribution and optimises it using the Wasserstein distance as a loss function.

### 3.  Methodological improvements
While traditional diffusion models can only denoise and reconstruct individual pixels, CONPREDIFF is able to better capture local contextual information by predicting the neighbourhood information around pixels/features/tokens, thus improving the quality of image generation. In addition, CONPREDIFF employs the Wasserstein distance as a loss function, allowing the model to reason without introducing too many parameters.

### 4. Issues addressed 
Traditional diffusion models have some problems in image generation, such as not capturing local contextual information well, resulting in low quality of generated images.CONPREDIFF solves this problem by predicting and reconstructing the neighbourhood information around pixels/features/tokens, which improves the quality of image generation. In addition, since CONPREDIFF employs the Wasserstein distance as a loss function, it can perform inference without introducing too many parameters, which improves the computational efficiency.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on the performance of the CONPREDIFF model on three tasks: text-to-image generation, image interpolation and unconditional image generation, and compares it with some existing diffusion and non-diffusion models. Specifically, in each task, the authors list the datasets and evaluation metrics used and provide a detailed comparison and analysis of the different models.

For **the text-to-image generation task**, the authors used the MS-COCO dataset and used FID and CLIP scores as evaluation metrics. The results show that the CONPREDIFF model outperforms all other models on both metrics, especially on the CLIP score. In addition, the authors provide visualisation results to demonstrate the performance of the model.

For **the image interpolation task**, the authors used CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets with LPIPS as the evaluation metric. The results show that the CONPREDIFF model performs better than the other models in most cases.

For **the unconditional image generation task**, the authors used the FFHQ and LSUN-Bedrooms datasets and used FID and Precision-and-Recall as evaluation metrics. The results show that the CONPREDIFF model outperforms all other models on both metrics, especially on Precision-and-Recall.

Overall, this paper demonstrates the superior performance of the CONPREDIFF model on multiple tasks and proves its effectiveness in retaining visual contextual information. In addition, the authors explore the impact and efficiency of neighbour prediction and demonstrate the generalisability of the method. 

## Conclusion

  1. The paper presents a new diffusion model, CONPREDIFF, for improved diffusion-based image synthesis and the ability to predict neighbourhood context information for each pixel/feature/marker.
  2. The method not only extends on existing continuous and discrete diffusion backbones, but also achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as unconditional image generation, text-to-image generation and image interpolation.
  3. In addition, the paper employs efficient decoding methods to handle large contexts and uses optimal transport loss of the Wasserstein distance to achieve structural constraints. These methods provide valuable references for future research on diffusion modelling.
 
### 2. Innovative points
  1. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose CONPREDIFF, a new diffusion model, which improves the performance of the diffusion model by forcing each pixel/feature/tag to predict its neighbourhood context information.
  2. And, the thesis designs efficient decoding methods and optimal transport losses to achieve better structural constraint effects. These innovations make the paper's method highly practical and scalable.

### 3. Future Works
  1. It could be further explored how to utilise more contextual information to improve the quality and diversity of the generated images.
  2. In addition, the method can be applied to other types of generative tasks in areas such as video generation and audio generation. In conclusion, the method proposed in this paper provides an important direction and idea for future research on diffusion modelling.
