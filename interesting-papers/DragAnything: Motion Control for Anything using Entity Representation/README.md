## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
Compared to existing motion control methods, ‘DragAnything’ has several advantages: first, the trajectory is more user-friendly based on interaction, whereas obtaining other guidance signals (e.g., masks, depth maps) is labour-intensive; second, the entity representation can be embedded as an open domain that can represent any object, thus enabling motion control of a variety of entities (including the background); and third, the entity representation can be embedded as an open domain that can represent any object, which enables motion control of a variety of entities (including backgrounds); and finally, the entity representation allows simultaneous and independent control of the motion of multiple objects. 

The experimental results show that ‘DragAnything’ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of FVD, FID, and user studies, especially in terms of object motion control, where the method outperforms the previous ‘DragNUWA’ method by 26% of the human vote score. 26 per cent of the human vote score.

### 2. Method Description 
This thesis proposes a trajectory-based video generation task that uses a given motion trajectory to synthesise the corresponding video. A conditional denoising self-encoder is designed for video generation by using the trajectory points, the first frame image, and a solid mask as guide signals. In the trajectory point representation, the authors observe that individual pixel points cannot accurately control the motion of an object and propose a novel entity representation mechanism to extract potential features of an object as its representation. In addition, a two-dimensional Gaussian representation is introduced to enhance the focus on the central region, thus improving the quality of the generated video.

### 3. Methodological improvements
Compared with the previous trajectory control method, the method employs a more refined entity representation mechanism to control the object's motion more accurately. Meanwhile, the combination of 2D Gaussian representation further enhances the focus on the central region and improves the quality of the generated video.

### 4. Issues addressed 
Traditional trajectory control methods can only achieve motion control of objects by directly manipulating pixels or pixel regions, but this method is not effective in controlling the motion of objects. Therefore, the entity representation mechanism and 2D Gaussian representation proposed in this method can better control the motion of objects and generate more realistic videos.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on the DragAnything model for the video generation task and conducts several comparative experiments to verify its performance. Specifically, this paper includes experiments in the following four areas:

**Experimental setup**: information on the implementation details and training parameters of the DragAnything model is presented;

**Comparison experiments**: the performance of the DragAnything model is evaluated in four aspects by comparing it with the current SOTA method DragNUWA, including video quality (FID), timing consistency (FVD), object motion control performance (ObjMC), and user voting evaluation;

**Dataset use**: the VIPSeg dataset used in this paper and its sources and processing are described;

**Ablation studies**: two core components, entity representation and 2D Gaussian representation, are experimentally analysed, while the role of the loss mask M is explored.

In the comparison experiments, the authors first utilise two automatic scripting metrics, FID and FVD, to assess video quality and temporal consistency, and the results show that the DragAnything model achieves significant superiority over DragNUWA in both aspects. Next, the authors used Euclidean distance to measure object motion control performance, and the results show that the DragAnything model achieves better performance on this metric as well. Finally, the authors also conducted a user voting evaluation, which showed that the DragAnything model received higher ratings for both motion control and video quality.

In the Ablation studies section, the authors experimentally analysed the two components, solid representation and 2D Gaussian representation, and found that they have a greater impact on the object motion control performance, and that a combination of the two gives the best results. In addition, the authors explored the role of loss mask M and found that it can bring some performance improvement.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. This thesis presents a new trajectory-based motion control method that enables accurate entity-level motion control and supports motion control in complex scenarios such as backgrounds.
  
  2. The method utilises potential features of the diffusion model to represent each entity, thus enabling interactive motion control of any object. Experimental results show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of user voting.
 
### 2. Innovative points
  1. The main contribution of this thesis is that it proposes a new entity-level motion control method, which solves the problem that traditional methods of dragging pixels cannot accurately control objects by using potential features of the diffusion model to represent each entity.
  
  2. In addition, the method supports motion control in complex scenes such as backgrounds with high flexibility and scalability.

### 3. Future Works
The entity-level motion control method proposed in this thesis provides a more fine-grained and flexible control for video generation tasks, which can be further applied to virtual reality, games and other fields. Future research directions include how to improve the efficiency and accuracy of entity-level motion control, and how to combine the method with other techniques to achieve more complex video generation tasks.
