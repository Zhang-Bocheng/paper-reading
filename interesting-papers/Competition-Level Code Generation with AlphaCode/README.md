## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
  By using a large dataset of programming competitions for training and evaluation and an efficient transformer architecture for model building, AlphaCode achieved excellent performance in simulated evaluations, with an average ranking in the top 54.3%. In addition, it employs large-scale model sampling and program behavior-based filtering to explore the search space and obtain reliable performance. These results show that AlphaCode is a promising technique to help programmers solve problems faster.

### 2. Method Description 
  This paper introduces a natural language processing system called AlphaCode, which is capable of automatically converting natural language problems into computer programs and solving them within a given time frame.The AlphaCode system consists of three main components: a natural language understanding module, an algorithm generation module, and a code generation module. The natural language understanding module is responsible for parsing the input natural language problem and extracting the key information; the algorithm generation module generates a solution automatically based on the input; and the code generation module converts the algorithm into executable code.
  
### 3. Methodological improvements
  Unlike traditional programming methods, the AlphaCode system does not require manual writing of programs to solve problems, but rather generates programs through automation. This automated approach can greatly increase the efficiency of programmers and also reduce the incidence of errors. In addition, the AlphaCode system is universal and can be applied to many different problem types.
  
### 4. Issues addressed 
  The AlphaCode system has a wide range of applications and can be used in various types of programming competitions, scientific research projects and automation control in industrial production. Especially in programming competitions, AlphaCode system can help participants to solve complex problems quickly and accurately, and improve their performance. In scientific research projects, AlphaCode systems can help researchers to quickly verify their theoretical hypotheses and accelerate the research process.
  
## Experiments
  This article describes the design and implementation of the AlphaCode system, which is designed to solve problem generation and solution challenges in programming competitions. The following comparison experiments are mainly covered in the article:

**Dataset comparison experiments**: two datasets are used for the experiments in this paper, namely the pre-training dataset based on GitHub and the fine-tuning dataset from CodeContests. Among them, the pre-training dataset is used for the initial training of the model, while the fine-tuning dataset is used to further optimize the model performance. 

**Model Architecture Comparison Experiments**: In this paper, several different model architectures are designed and compared for experiments. These models include different parameter scales, hidden dimensions, queries and number of key-value headers. By comparing these models, the optimal model architecture can be found to improve the performance of the model.

**Large Scale Sample Generation and Filtering Experiment**: since there are only 10 submission opportunities for each problem, it is very important to generate high quality candidate solutions efficiently. This paper adopts the method of large-scale sample generation and filter the generated samples to obtain higher quality candidate solutions. Experiments comparing this method with other methods such as top-k and nucleus sampling can prove that large-scale sample generation and filtering are effective solutions.

**Clustering experiment**: after sample filtering, there will still be many candidate solutions left. In order to avoid submitting the same solutions repeatedly, this paper adopts a clustering approach to group solutions with the same output results. By comparing experiments of this method with other methods (e.g. random selection), clustering can be proved to be an effective solution.

Overall, this paper validates the effectiveness and superiority of the AlphaCode system through several comparative experiments. The system can help people generate high-quality solutions faster and improve the efficiency and accuracy of programming competitions.

## Conclusion

### 2. Innovative points
  The methodological innovation of this paper is to propose a system based on large-scale sampling to solve the programming problem.
