## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The method utilises an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model (e.g. Stable Diffusion) to generate high-quality content images as reference images, and introduces an efficient cascading potential diffusion module and a stream-based temporal up-sampling step to generate latent video representations, which are finally mapped to high-definition video by an enhanced video decoder. During training, the method is trained using the first frame of a real video as a reference image for the cascaded potential diffusion module. Experimental results show that this method achieves new best results in text-to-video generation tasks.

### 2. Method Description 
The video generation method proposed in this paper is called VideoGen, and its main process consists of three parts: **reference image generation, reference-guided latent variable diffusion, and streaming spatio-temporal super-resolution module**. 
<br>&emsp;A high quality reference image is first generated using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative model; 
<br>&emsp;the text is then embedded into the network through a trans-attentive mechanism and fed, together with the representation of the reference image, into a reference-guided latent variable diffusion module, which consists of three consecutive components: a latent variable diffusion network with spatial and temporal resolutions of 16x16 and two latent variable diffusion networks with spatial super-resolution of 32x32 and 64x64; 
<br>&emsp;finally, spatio-temporal super-resolution processing is performed in the latent variable representation space in order to obtain a high-definition video output.

### 3. Methodological improvements
VideoGen adopts a latent variable representation-based generation approach compared to the traditional pixel-level based video generation method, which makes the generation process more efficient and produces higher quality video output. In addition, the authors introduced the concept of a reference image to effectively guide the subsequent latent variable sequence generation process, which further improves the quality of video generation.

### 4. Issues addressed 
The goal of VideoGen is to generate high-quality video output while minimising computational cost and storage requirements. By introducing the concepts of latent variable representation and reference image, VideoGen successfully solves many problems existing in traditional video generation methods, such as high computational complexity and poor generation quality.

## Experiments
This paper presents experimental results and comparative experiments on the video generation method VideoGen. The authors used the publicly available dataset WebVid-10M to train a reference-guided cascaded latent video diffusion network, and performed quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two datasets, UCF-101 and MSR-VTT.

First, for quantitative evaluation, the authors compare VideoGen with recent text-to-video generation methods such as Make-A-Video, CogVideo, VDM, LVDM, TATS, MagicVideo, DIGAN, and NuÂ¨wa. On the MSR-VTT dataset, the authors use the average CLIPSIM score as an evaluation metric, and the results show that VideoGen achieves the highest average CLIPSIM score in the zero-sample setting, demonstrating good content consistency between the generated video and text.

On the UCF-101 dataset, the authors report Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Video Distance (FVD), two commonly used evaluation metrics. Under the zero-sample setting, VideoGen's IS score increased from 33 to 71.6, greatly improving the quality score, while the FVD score also performed well. In the fine-tuning setting, although only the first latent video diffusion model was fine-tuned, it still showed excellent results.

Secondly, in terms of qualitative assessment, the authors show some examples generated by VideoGen, demonstrating its rich texture details, excellent spatio-temporal stability and motion consistency. In addition, the authors further validate VideoGen's effectiveness through visual comparisons and user studies. For example, both CLIPSIM scores and IS indices decrease when the reference condition is removed, suggesting that reference images are very effective in improving visual quality and helping to learn better motion patterns. And a temporal super-resolution approach using streaming guidance produces more stable interpolated frames, and the authors' own video decoder is able to recover the video better and make it smoother than the original image decoder.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. This paper propose a new text-to-video generation method, VideoGen, which improves the visual quality by utilising an existing text-to-image generation model and uses a reference image as a guiding condition to train an efficient video generation model.
  
  2. In addition, the method is able to train a video decoder using unpaired high-quality video data, which further improves the quality of the generated video.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. **Leveraging existing text-to-image generation models to improve visual quality**: the authors use a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to generate a high-quality reference image, which is then used as a guiding condition to train a video generation model. This approach not only improves visual quality, but also saves a lot of training time and computational resources.

  2. **Using a reference image as a guidance condition to train a video generation model**: the authors designed an implicit diffusion-based video generation model that uses a reference image as a condition to learn video motion at each time step. This approach makes the video generation model more focused on learning video motion rather than learning visual content.

  3. **Using unpaired high-quality video data to train the video decoder**: The authors propose a new training strategy that uses unpaired high-quality video data to train the video decoder. This approach not only saves a lot of annotation cost, but also improves the quality of the generated videos.
 
### 3. Future Works
  1. **Explore more video generation techniques**: currently, the video generation technique used in this paper is based on implicit diffusion, but there are some other video generation techniques that can be tried, such as methods based on variational self-encoders, etc.

  2. **In-depth study of dynamic changes in video generation**: current video generation methods mainly focus on how to generate smooth and realistic video sequences, but in practical applications, it is also necessary to consider the dynamic changes in the video, such as the movement of the object, rotation and so on.

  3.**Combining speech synthesis technology**: In addition to text-to-video generation, speech synthesis is also a very important application scenario. Therefore, combining text-to-video generation with speech synthesis to achieve multimodal information generation is a direction worth exploring.
