## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
This paper describes an open source code system called OpenCodeInterpreter that aims to address the limitations of current large-scale language models for code generation. The system integrates code generation, execution, and iterative improvement, and enables dynamic code improvement through the Code-Feedback dataset. Experimental results show that OpenCodeInterpreter performs excellently, achieving similar or even better results than GPT-4 Code Interpreter in benchmark tests such as HumanEval and MBPP. This result fills the gap between open source code generation models and proprietary systems.
