| 2021 | This paper examines four fallacies in the field of artificial intelligence and suggests that these fallacies can lead to overly optimistic predictions about the development of AI.         |  AI         |

## Methodology

The authors argue that one of the reasons for these cycles of optimism and disappointment is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence. The authors also mention some of the fallacies that inspire open questions, including the age-old challenge of how to give machines human common sense. Despite breakthroughs in AI, delivering on the long-term promise of technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions remains much more difficult than many expect.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on the history and current dilemmas of AI and presents four misconceptions about AI. Among these misconceptions, the first is equating narrow intelligence with general intelligence, the second is underestimating the complexity of the human mind, the third is using misleading terminology to describe the capabilities of AI, and the fourth is believing that intelligence exists exclusively in the brain while ignoring the role of the body.

For each misconception, the paper provides a detailed explanation and relevant research findings. 
<br>&emsp;In the first misconception, the authors state that although machines are capable of performing some specific tasks, they lack the ability to understand and create and therefore cannot be considered truly intelligent. 
<br>&emsp;In the second misconception, the authors cite psychologist Gary Marcus, stating that human understanding of perception and movement is very complex and that this understanding is often unconscious. 
<br>&emsp;In a third misconception, the authors refer to AI terms used by companies such as IBM and DeepMind, such as ‘reading,’ ‘understanding,’ and ‘targeting,’ which are actually describing machine learning algorithms. terms that actually describe the performance of machine learning algorithms rather than true intelligence.
<br>&emsp;Finally, in the fourth misconception, the authors point out that many AI systems still rely on digital brain models, ignoring the role of the body.

In conclusion, by analysing the current dilemmas facing AI, this paper reveals some common misconceptions and provides some new ways of thinking to help us better understand the nature and direction of AI.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. The paper delves into four fallacies that exist in the field of artificial intelligence and identifies the reasons why these fallacies lead us to overestimate machine intelligence.
  
  2. The paper raises questions such as how to assess progress in general-purpose or human-level AI, and how to compare the level of difficulty in different fields, which can help further research and development of AI.
  
  3. The paper also discusses how to improve understanding of AI, particularly in terms of collaboration in cognitive science and other related disciplines.
Points of methodological innovation

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The thesis proposes a methodology for applying knowledge of child development in psychology to machine learning in order to help machines acquire basic knowledge and abilities.
   
  2. The paper cites several historical events and expert opinions that are compared and analysed to reveal misconceptions and biases in the field of artificial intelligence.
     
### 3. Future Works
  1. The paper calls for a more cautious approach to the development of AI, avoiding excessive optimism and disappointment.
  
  2. The paper points out that to truly understand the nature of AI, a closer partnership between multiple disciplines is needed to better address the challenges facing AI.
