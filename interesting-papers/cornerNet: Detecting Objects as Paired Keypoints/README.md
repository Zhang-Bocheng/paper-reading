| 2019 | This paper introduces a new object detection method, CornerNet, which uses a single convolutional neural network to detect two keypoints of an object's bounding box: the upper left and lower right corners.         | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)       |

## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
By representing the object as a pair of keypoints, the anchor frame design commonly used in a priori single-stage detectors is avoided. In addition, the authors introduce a corner pooling layer that can help the network to better locate the corners. Experimental results show that CornerNet achieves an average accuracy of 42.2% on the MS COCO dataset, outperforming all existing single-stage detectors.

### 2. Method Description 
The paper proposes an object detection method called CornerNet, whose core idea is to view an object as two keypoints - the upper left and lower right corners - and to determine the object's location by predicting the positions of these two keypoints. Specifically, CornerNet uses a backbone network called the hourglass network to extract image features, and based on this, predicts the heat map, embedding vectors, and offsets for each category. Among them, the heat map is used to indicate whether the keypoints at different locations belong to a certain category, the embedding vector is used to distinguish different objects in the same category, and the offset is used to fine-tune the locations of the keypoints to improve the positioning accuracy.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. Compared to the traditional method based on region proposal, CornerNet does not need to generate candidate frames first, but predicts the positions of keypoints directly in the original image, thus avoiding the tedious process of region proposal.
  
  2. And CornerNet introduces the concept of embedding vectors, which can effectively deal with the similarity and difference problems between multiple objects, further improving the detection performance.
     
### 4. Issues addressed 
The goal of CornerNet is to minimise the amount of computation and storage space while ensuring high detection accuracy. To this end, the method employs a variety of technical tools, such as Hourglass network, Corner Pooling layer, etc., which enable the model to achieve efficient object detection tasks with less spatial complexity.

## Experiments
This paper describes several comparative experiments conducted on CornerNet, including network structure and hyperparameter tuning, data enhancement, etc. The specific experiments are as follows:

**Network structure and hyper-parameter tuning experiment (Sec. 4.4.1)**: the authors compare the model performance with and without corner pooling, and find that corner pooling significantly improves the detection accuracy, especially on medium and large objects.

**Corner Pooling Stability Experiment (Sec. 4.4.2)**: The authors investigate the effect of corner pooling by detecting corners in different regions, and the results show that corner pooling is effective and stable for corners of different sizes.

**Diagonal Penalty Adjustment Experiment (Sec. 4.4.3)**: The authors compare the effects of diagonal penalties under fixed and object-dependent distances, and the results show that the penalties are more effective under object-dependent distances.

**Small Object Detection Experiment (Sec. 4.4.4)**: the authors compare the performance of the model using Hourly Light Network and FPN as the backbone network, and the results show that Hourly Light Network is more suitable for CornerNet.

**Bounding box quality experiment (Sec. 4.4.5)**: the authors compare the quality of bounding boxes generated by CornerNet and other existing detectors, and the results show that CornerNet is able to generate higher quality bounding boxes.

**Error analysis experiments (Sec. 4.4.6)**: the authors analyse the contribution of each component to the final error rate by replacing the predicted corner heatmaps, offsets and embedding vectors, and the results show that corner detection is the main bottleneck.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. The paper proposes a new object detection method, CornerNet, which treats object detection as a relational problem between four corners and uses the four corners as the detection frame.
  
  2. The authors conducted experiments on the MS COCO dataset and compared it with existing methods, and the results show that CornerNet performs competitively.
The paper describes the implementation details of CornerNet in detail, including the network structure design and loss function selection.
Method Innovation Points

### 2. Innovative points
  1. CornerNet is a new object detection method that differs from traditional region-based methods or single-stage detectors by directly predicting the location and bounding box of an object.
  
  2. CornerNet uses four corners as the detection frame, a representation that is more intuitive and easy to understand, and avoids some problems that may occur in traditional methods, such as overlapping bounding boxes.
  
  3. In terms of network structure, CornerNet adopts a pyramid structure, which can handle objects of different scales at the same time and solve the rotation problem by angle normalisation.
     
### 3. Future Works
  1. CornerNet proposed in this paper is a promising method for object detection, but there is still some room for improvement, such as how to better handle small targets and occlusion.
  
  2. Future research directions may include further optimising the network structure, introducing more prior knowledge and combining other techniques (e.g. semantic segmentation) to improve the detection performance.
