## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The method utilizes the complex higher-order relationships between individuals and groups in a crowd and performs relational inference by extracting human features and location information to provide additional group information for reconstruction. Experimental results show that the method outperforms other baseline methods in both crowded and normal scenes. In addition, the authors provide pseudo-labeled datasets to facilitate future research.

### 2. Method Description 
This thesis presents a multi-pose reconstruction method for crowds based on hypergraph networks. 
<br>&emsp;Firstly, effective image features of each individual are extracted by predicting the bounding box of the crowd, and these features are utilized as individuals input into the hypergraph network. 
<br>&emsp;Then, the nodes and edges in the hypergraph network are used to represent the relationship between individuals and the crowd, and the hypergraph structure is used to achieve efficient modeling of complex data correlations and higher-order data correlations. 
<br>&emsp;Finally, individual features are combined with hypergraph information to compensate for insufficient individual information and accurately reconstruct the 3D shape and pose of the population.

### 3. Methodological improvements
The method improves on the traditional human pose estimation method by introducing the concept of hypergraph network, which is able to better capture the interactions and collective behaviors in the crowd. Meanwhile, the accuracy of absolute position prediction can be further improved by introducing crowd constraints.

### 4. Issues addressed 
The method solves the problem of multi-person pose reconstruction in crowded scenes with high accuracy and robustness. In addition, the method provides a richer dataset for subsequent research, which helps to promote the research progress in the field of crowd analysis.

## Experiments
This paper presents research work on human pose estimation and 3D human modeling in large-scale crowded scenarios, and conducts several sets of experiments to validate the effectiveness of the methods. Specifically, the authors use three benchmark datasets, Panoptic, GigaCrowd, and JTA, to conduct the experiments, where GigaCrowd is a large 3D crowd reconstruction dataset to test the performance of the method in complex crowded scenes. The authors used a variety of evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the methods, including PA-PPDS, OKS, and PCOD. Also, the authors compared the method with other methods, including CRMH, BEV, PandaNet, etc.

The experimental results showed that the authors' method achieved excellent results on several indicators, especially when dealing with large-scale populations. In addition, the authors conducted multiple sets of experiments to analyze the effects of different parameters on the performance of the method, such as population size, group size, and so on. Finally, the authors derived the strengths and limitations of the method through a series of experiments and proposed some future research directions.

  1. In this paper, a novel Hypergraph Relational Reasoning Network (HRN) is proposed to solve the problem of multi-person reconstruction in a single image.
  
  2. The method is able to deal with the relationship between individuals and groups simultaneously and achieves better results in large-scale crowd scenarios.
  
  3. In addition, the authors constructed a dataset containing more than one million people, which provides strong support for subsequent research.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. Compared with the traditional human body keypoint-based approach, the HRN model proposed in this paper can better capture the interactions in the crowd, thus improving the quality of the reconstruction results.
  
  2. Meanwhile, the method can also be used to reorganize the population in an interactive way, which further extends its application scope.
     
### 3. Future Works
