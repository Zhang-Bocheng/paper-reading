| 2023 |  This paper describes a new framework called DreamStyler for artistic image compositing and style transformation.         | Computer Vision         |

## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The framework produces high-quality images by optimising multi-stage text embedding and context-aware text cueing, and features flexible content and style guidance to accommodate various style references. Experimental results show that DreamStyler exhibits excellent performance in several scenarios and has good application prospects.

### 2. Method Description 
This paper proposes DreamStyler, a text-guided art style based conversion tool, whose core idea is to combine the input content image with a specified art style to generate a new image with the artist's style. The method mainly consists of the following steps:

<br>&emsp;Project the input image into the latent space using the stable diffusion (SD) model.
<br>&emsp;Based on the given text cues, each token is converted into an embedding vector using a CLIP text encoder and passed to the conditional diffusion model.
<br>&emsp;The diffusion model is trained over multiple time steps to learn the mapping relationships between different art styles.
<br>&emsp;Combine the content image with the desired art style to generate a new image through an inverse process.

In addition, techniques such as multi-stage text inversion (TI) and context-aware text cueing are proposed in this paper to improve the performance of DreamStyler.

### 3. Methodological improvements
While traditional art style conversion methods usually require a lot of manual intervention and adjustment of parameters, DreamStyler leverages the powerful representation capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image models as well as diffusion models, enabling users to achieve style conversion more easily. At the same time, by introducing techniques such as multi-stage text inversion and context-aware text cues, DreamStyler is also able to better separate stylistic and non-stylistic elements in an image, thus improving the quality of the style conversion.

### 4. Issues addressed 
Traditional artistic style conversion methods suffer from many problems, such as difficulty in accurately capturing stylistic elements in images, the need for a lot of manual intervention and parameter adjustments, etc. DreamStyler achieves automated, efficient, and high-quality artistic style conversions by utilising pre-trained text-to-image models and diffusion models. In addition, by introducing techniques such as multi-stage text inversion and context-aware text cueing, DreamStyler is also able to better separate stylistic and non-stylistic elements in images, thus solving the problems of traditional methods.

## Experiments
This paper presents the experimental results and performance of DreamStyler, a style transformation model, and compares it with other approaches. Specifically, the authors conducted experiments in the following two areas:

**Style Transfer task (Style Transfer)**: in this task, the authors used CLIP image similarity as an evaluation metric to compare DreamStyler with previous studies. The experimental results showed that DreamStyler achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of both text and image scores and user preferences.

**Text-to-Image Synthesis task (Text-to-Image Synthesis)**: in this task, the authors compared DreamStyler with other diffusion-based personalisation methods. The experimental results show that DreamStyler is able to effectively balance the trade-off between text and style quality, not only faithfully following the textual cues, but also accurately reflecting the artistic features in the styled images.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. The paper proposes a novel image generation method, DreamStyler, which is capable of generating artful images based on given artistic style references and achieves remarkable performance in text-to-image synthesis and style conversion tasks.
  
  2. Meanwhile, the authors improve the overall effectiveness of DreamStyler by introducing technical tools such as extended text embedding space S and multi-stage TI.
  
  3.  In addition, the authors proposed context-aware cue enhancement and style and context guidance, which enable users to adjust the output results according to their preferences or the complexity of the reference image.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The authors encapsulate the artistic style information into the CLIP text space, which allows for more accurate capture of the differences between different styles;
  
  2. The authors introduce an extended text embedding space S, which allows for the capacity of the personalisation module to be increased, and at the same time better exploits the different contributions of the different diffusion steps to the image synthesis;
  
  3. The authors employ context-aware cue enhancement and style and context guidance, enabling users to tailor image generation to their needs.

### 3. Future Works
further optimisation of model design and training strategies is needed when dealing with more complex artistic styles; also, how to achieve more efficient and scalable image generation remains an important research direction. Therefore, future research can start from these aspects to further promote the development of image generation techniques.
