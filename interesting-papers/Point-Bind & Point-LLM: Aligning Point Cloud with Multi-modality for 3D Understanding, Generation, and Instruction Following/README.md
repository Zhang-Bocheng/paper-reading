## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The model can construct joint embedding spaces between 3D and multimodality, enabling a variety of applications such as arbitrary-to-3D generation, 3D embedding arithmetic, and 3D open-world understanding. On this basis, the authors also present the first large-scale language model (Point-LLM) based on 3D multimodal commands, which injects the semantics of Point-Bind into a pre-trained language model, such as LLaMA, through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, thus improving its performance in 3D and multimodal question and answer.

### 2. Method Description 
This paper propose a multimodal learning framework called Point-Bind for learning 3D point clouds with three other modalities such as image, text, and audio in a joint embedding space. The framework consists of three main parts: **collection of datasets, comparison training, and cross-modal application.**

First, a cross-modal dataset is constructed by using the 3D-image-text triad from ULIP and the 3D-audio binary from ESC-50 and ShapeNet. Contrastive training is then performed on this dataset to simultaneously tune the relationship between the 3D point cloud and the other three modalities. Finally, the joint embedding space is utilized to implement various cross-modal applications.

In addition, the authors propose a Point-Bind-based 3D Large Language Model (Point-LLM) that is fine-tuned with multimodal instructions based on ImageBind-LLM and demonstrates excellent parameter and data efficiency.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. Compared to traditional single-modal learning methods, Point-Bind can better capture the shape, texture, sound, and other information of the object by combining the 3D point cloud with the other three modalities, which improves the model's expressiveness and generalization ability. 

  2. In addition, Point-BLM adopts a parameter-efficient training strategy, which requires only a small number of parameters to be fine-tuned to achieve better performance.

### 4. Issues addressed 
Point-Bind and Point-LLM solve the following problems respectively:

  1. Point-Bind: How to learn a 3D point cloud with three other modalities for joint embedding in space.
  
  2. Point-LLM: How to develop a 3D large language model with 3D question and answer capability and multimodal reasoning.

## Experiments
This paper presents the experimental details and result analysis of the multimodal learning framework Point-Bind. The framework achieves multimodal embedding space alignment between point clouds and other modal data by combining a pre-trained 3D encoder with a multimodal projection network, and is tested on several tasks.

First, **in the multimodal instruction-following task**, the authors used ImageBind-LLM to perform parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning of the pre-trained LLAMA model to inject 3D instructions. By testing the ability to answer English and Chinese instructions, the authors demonstrate that Point-LLM has good 3D instruction comprehension and cross-modal reasoning. In addition, the authors show that Point-LLM can answer complex questions about the input point cloud and can understand and process information from other modalities.

Second, **in the 3D cross-modal retrieval task**, the authors adopted a zero-sample retrieval approach and conducted experiments using the ModelNet40 dataset. The results show that Point-Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in all comparative benchmarks, especially in the 2D-to-3D and text-to-3D retrieval tasks, improving the mean accuracy (mAP) by 14.29% and 13.99% over the second-place ULIP method.

Third, **for 3D embedding spatial arithmetic**, the authors directly sum 3D and audio embeddings and retrieve 2D images from the ImageNet dataset. The results show that Point-Bind can effectively combine features from different modalities and merge their semantic information well to achieve favorable cross-modal retrieval capacity.

Fourth, **in the any-to-3D generation task**, the authors employed CLIP-Forge's decoder and generated satisfactory 3D meshes with text, audio, and point cloud cues. This further demonstrates that Point-Bind's embedding space is well-aligned and allows for seamless transitions between multiple modalities.

Finally, **in the 3D zero-sample comprehension task**, the authors tested Point-Bind's open-world comprehension capabilities by performing 3D zero-sample classification on the ModelNet40 dataset. The results show that Point-Bind outperforms existing methods and exhibits strong emerging 3D open-world recognition capabilities.
