## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The authors conducted experiments using machine learning models and feature engineering methods and demonstrated that fine-tuning using medium-sized pre-trained language models results in better performance. In addition, they show through zero-sample cueing tests that the uniqueness and complexity of the task requires more exploration and improvement.

### 2. Method Description 
The entity importance detection model proposed in this paper is based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and uses a Cross-encoder architecture. Documents and target entities are first connected and encoded using Special Entity Separators (SEPs). The entire text is then processed through a Transformer encoder, enabling the model to have a deep cross-attention mechanism, while adding positional embedding vectors at each entity occurrence using the special markers [BEGIN_ENTITY] and [END_ENTITY]. Finally, the encoded [CLS] markers are summed with the average positional embedding vectors and fed into the scoring module to produce an entity importance score. The scoring module is a fully connected network with a sigmoid function for activation.

### 3. Methodological improvements
  1. **Utilising the power of pre-trained language models**: pre-trained language models have been trained on large-scale corpora and can learn a wealth of linguistic knowledge, and can therefore be used to improve the effectiveness of entity importance detection.
  
  2. **Use of cross-coder architecture**: cross-coder is a commonly used architecture for natural language understanding tasks, which can effectively capture contextual information in a document to better determine the importance of entities.

### 4. Issues addressed 
Entity importance is the degree of importance of an entity in a given document, which is usually determined by its frequency of occurrence in the document, contextual relationships, and other factors. Entity importance detection is the basis of many natural language processing tasks, such as question and answer systems, machine translation, etc. The method proposed in this paper can efficiently identify important entities in documents and provide fundamental support for these tasks.

## Experiments
This paper presents an experimental study for the task of entity importance detection and compares and analyses different approaches. Specifically, four datasets (NYT-Salience, WN-Salience, SEL, and EntSUM) as well as multiple machine learning and deep learning based approaches are used in this paper for experimental comparison. Among other things, the experimental results show that the use of the cross-coder model can significantly outperform other benchmark methods, achieving better performance in terms of F1 scores. In addition, this paper analyses the impact of different factors, including inferring the importance of all entity mentions, the position of the first entity mention, and the frequency of entity mentions. Through these experiments and analyses, this paper provides valuable references and insights for research in this area.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. The paper presents an entity importance detection method based on a pre-trained language model, which is experimentally validated on four different datasets. The method achieves significant improvements with higher accuracy and efficiency compared to previous methods.
  
  2. In addition, the study provides two datasets labelled by humans and created semi-automatically, providing a unified benchmark for future research on entity importance detection.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The main contribution of this thesis is to propose a new approach to entity importance detection that uses a pre-trained language model to encode relevant information about entities in a text and predicts the entity's importance score through a classifier.
  
  2. This approach not only avoids tedious manual feature engineering, but also improves the performance by utilising the large amount of semantic knowledge in the pre-trained language model.
  
  3. In addition, the method can also take into account information about the location where entities appear, further improving accuracy.
 
### 3. Future Works
  1. The method is only applicable to English documents, and for other languages it may be necessary to retrain the pre-trained language model. In addition, the method needs more external knowledge to improve performance, which is one of the future research directions.
     
  2. Overall, the entity importance detection method proposed in this paper provides a promising direction for the field of natural language processing, which deserves further exploration and development.
