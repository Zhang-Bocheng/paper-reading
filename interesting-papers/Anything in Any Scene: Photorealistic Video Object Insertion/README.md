## Methodology

### 1. Abstract
The framework consists of three key processes: first, a real object is appropriately placed in the video of a given scene to ensure geometric realism; second, sky and ambient lighting distributions are estimated and realistic shadows are simulated to enhance light realism; and lastly, the final output is optimised using a style-shifting network to maximise photorealism. 

The experimental results show that the ‘Anything in Any Scene’ framework can produce simulated videos with high geometric, lighting and photorealistic qualities. This framework not only effectively addresses the challenges of video data generation, but can also be applied to virtual reality, video editing, and a variety of other video-related applications.

### 2. Method Description
The paper proposes a video compositing framework called ‘Anything in Any Scene’ for generating high-quality videos of large-scale scenes. The framework consists of three main components: **object placement and stabilisation, lighting and shadow generation, and style transfer**. First, a visual data query engine is used to retrieve relevant scene video clips from an asset library, and 3D models of the target objects are inserted into the existing video clips. Then, stable placement of the object is achieved by considering other objects in the scene. Finally, real lighting effects are simulated by estimating the position of the main light source and rendering shadows. In addition, an image interpolation network is used to faithfully transmit the style to enhance the realism of the simulated video sequences.

### 3. Methodological improvements
Compared to traditional video compositing methods, the framework employs more advanced techniques such as 3D model generation and ray tracing to improve the quality and realism of the composited video. Also, the framework includes efficient computational resource management and optimisation algorithms to ensure efficient operation in large-scale scenarios.

### 4. Issues addressed 
The framework solves the problem of large-scale scenes and complex object insertion that cannot be handled by traditional video compositing methods. By using pre-trained 3D models and high-quality texture mapping, arbitrary objects can be inserted into any scene quickly and accurately. In addition, the framework can adaptively adjust lighting and shadow effects according to different lighting conditions to make the composite video more realistic. Ultimately, the framework can help researchers and artists better explore the fields of virtual reality and computer graphics.

## Experiments
This paper focuses on the video simulation approach of the Anything in Any scene framework with detailed experimental evaluation and application validation. In the experimental part, the authors use two evaluation metrics to quantify the performance: human score and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. Meanwhile, they use several datasets to validate the effectiveness of the framework, including the outdoor scene video dataset PandaSet and the indoor scene video dataset ScanNet++, as well as a variety of datasets with inserted objects.

Firstly, the authors compare different approaches to style transfer networks, including the CNN-based approach DoveNet, the transformer-based approach StyTR2, the diffusion model-based approach PHDiffusion and their proposed Anything in Any scene approach. The results show that their method performs the best in terms of FID scores and human ratings, outperforming the other methods.

Second, the authors conducted a module elimination experiment to evaluate the contribution of each key module by removing a module from the framework. The results show that removing modules such as placement, HDR image reconstruction, shadow generation, and style transformation all lead to higher FID scores. In particular, adding shadows significantly enhances the perceived realism of the human observer, although this is not fully reflected in the FID score. This suggests that there may be a gap between computational assessment and human judgement.

In addition, the authors provide a visual comparison of sample video frames, showing the results of different style transfer networks applied to the Panda dataset. The results show that their method outperforms other methods in terms of visual quality with better consistency.

Finally, the authors use the Anything in Any scene framework for the evaluation of downstream perceptual tasks. They tested the performance of three models, YOLOX-S, YOLOX-L and YOLOX-X, on the COODA dataset to detect rare object classes. By applying the Anything in Any scene framework to the training images, the amount of training data is increased, which improves the model's mean accuracy (mAP). Specifically, mAP is improved by 3.7% for YOLOX-S, 1.1% for YOLOX-L, and 2.6% for YOLOX-X.

## Conclusion

### 1. Advantages of the Thesis
  1. The framework is able to dynamically place objects in different scenes and demonstrates its superiority in terms of quality and speed by evaluating geometric fidelity and lighting fidelity.
  2. In addition, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in downstream tasks such as target detection and the solution of long-tailed distribution problems.

### 2. Innovative points
  1. The method uses an asset library containing videos and object models for various scenarios. The method then selects appropriate scene videos by querying visual descriptors and dynamically places objects in the scene.
  2. And, the method uses illumination estimation and shadow generation techniques to improve the quality of the inserted videos. Finally, the method also implements realistic style transfer to further enhance the realism of the video.

### 3. Future Works
  future improvements may include aspects such as optimising the algorithm and hardware acceleration. In addition, the method can be combined with other techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, to further improve its performance and application scope.
